You will need to calibrate your own SX1278 temperator sensor in order to get accurate results in the OS-42's downlink. 

#Note

This is NOT to be used for precise measurements or sondings of the atmosphere! It is to provide an approximation of the internal temperature of the OS-42 transmitter. 

#Calibration materials 

- A known sensor to work well. If you know your room temperature is 23*C, use that, as the temperature sensor noise will likely cancel that error out.

#Calibration process

- The process is very simple. To calibrate, simply take the internal temperature and subtract it from the known temperature. This is your calibration factor. 
- Enter the calibration factor into the configuration and flash the firmware.
