Pseudocode:

Setup:
1. Check if first time running, not going from deep sleep. 
2. If first time running, turn on GPS and wait for it to connect
3. Begin camera
4. Begin transmitter
5. Transmit "on" beacon (1 byte of VCID, plus 255 bytes of 0x00)
6. Set first time running to false

Loop:
1. Initialize camera
2. Write image to buffer
3. *OPTIONAL* Encode SSDV
4. Transmit 255 bytes of image *OPTIONAL* 3x with repeat flag on
5. Transmit rest of image
6. Release camera buffer
7. Turn on GPS and grab GPS data
8. Transmit GPS data 4x
9. Increase number of tx images by 1
10. Calculate new sleep time, defined by the curve y=(1/1000)x^2 + 1, where y is sleep time in seconds
11. Sleep for the amount required
